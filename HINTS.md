# Hints and Tips :tada:

1. Go through each criteria, and create a flow of what you need to do.

1. We've been used a lot of prompts and confirms in the activities, it would be excellent if these we're used!

1. You've been given a call to `generatePasssword()` - this is for you to create separately to the `writePassword()`

1. Look back on the recording for a demo of how to get buttons to hookup to javascript functionality - and a breakdown of the query selector!

1. Focus on the javascript here, the HTML and CSS has already been done for you bar some tweaks.

1. No really, you should use the special characters referenced in the README.

# Submission Checklist :rocket:

1. Ensure that you submit both a link to your homework repo **and** your live github pages link.
   > Check for sneaky console errors!
2. Ensure what you've submitted works when you grade it yourself against the:

   - The user stories provided
   - The acceptance criteria's provided.

3. Make sure your homework repo has a quality README that _you_ have written, and provide screenshots and a github pages link!

4. Commit after most changes, all that code doesn't just appear first time :wink:

5. **Comment that JavaScript code :pray:**
